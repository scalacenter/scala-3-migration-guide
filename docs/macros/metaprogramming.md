title: Metaprogramming in Scala 3
---

The Scala 2 macros are compiler-dependent by design. A macros compiled by a version of the compiler cannot be used by another version of the compiler.

Scala 3 is overcoming this limitation by introducing a new principled approach of metaprogramming. While this is an uncontested improvement, it also means that previous macro implementations have to be rewritten from the ground up.

## Before rewriting a macro

Before getting deep into reimplementing a macro your should check if it can be supported using Scala 3 new features.

* Can I encode the logic of the macro using the new scala 3 features?
* Can I use *match types* to reimplement the interface of my macro?
* Can I use `inline` and the metaprogramming features in `scala.compiletime` to reimplement my logic?
* Can I use the simpler and safer expression based macros to implement my macro?
* Do I really need to have access to the raw AST trees?

You can find references to these concepts in the _macro tutorial_.
