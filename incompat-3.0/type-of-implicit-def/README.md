## Type Of Implicit Definition

Type of implicit definitions (`val` or `def`) are now required by the Scala 3 compiler.
They cannot be inferred.

Wherever the type annotation of an implicit definition is missing, the Scala 3 compiler will print an error message of the form:

```
-- Error: src/main/scala/type-of-implicit-def.scala:4:15 
4 |  implicit val context = new Context {}
  |               ^
  |               type of implicit definition needs to be given explicitly
```

#### Scalafix rewrite

The Scalafix rule named `ExplicitImplicitTypes` in [ohze/scala-rewrites](https://github.com/ohze/scala-rewrites#fixexplicittypesexplicitimplicittypes) repository can write the missing type annotations automatically.
